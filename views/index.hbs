	        <div class="answer">
	          Any full-time high school student and U.S. resident attending a public, private, or home-school in the Greater Boston Area at the time of his application, where the Greater Boston Area is defined as schools/homes within a 30-mile radius of Boston City Hall (1 City Hall Square, Boston, MA 02201).  All students who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered, but we especially encourage students to apply that satisfy the following criteria:
	          <br /> <br />
	          <ul>

	          	<li>Coming from a high school with low admittance rates to top-tier colleges, especially rural or predominantly minority high schools</li>
	          	<li>Potentially the first family member to attend college</li>
	          	<li>Absence of science and engineering degrees in family</li>
	          	<li>Underserved, defined as coming from low socioeconomic means, which may be indicated by qualification for free/reduced lunch</li>

	         <br />
	        <div class="answer">
	          The Out of the Box competition is, at its core, about a cool idea or project that a student wants to develop; we encourage applicants to submit proposals in whatever form they feel best conveys their idea. The proposal should focus on summarizing your ideaâ€™s feasibility, impact, and innovation. Some examples of potential proposals are listed below, but feel free to utilize a method not listed.
	          <br /> <br />
	          <ul>
	          	<li> Written paper (1-2 pages total) </li>
	          	<li> Video (under 5 min length) submission </li>
	          </ul>
	          <br />

				Each submission should also include a section where an applicant(s) describes how any funding from MIT THINK would benefit them.

	          How are the proposals evaluated?
	        </div>
	         <br />
	        <div class="answer">

	         <br />
	        <div class="answer">
	          Once the semifinalists are accepted, they will work with mentors on the THINK team as well as MIT professors in the associated field to develop their project proposal further and learn more about the surrounding field of science.  After this process, the semifinalists that have demonstrated sufficient passion and dedication will be selected as finalists, and given $1,000 in seed funding as well as mentorship from the THINK team to develop their projects to reality.

	         <br />
	        <div class="answer">
	          There is no set number, but we expect to choose up to 15 students as semifinalists, and as many deserving semifinalists as possible to fund as finalists.
